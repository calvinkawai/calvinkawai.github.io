## Weight-lifting

- You should be doing both **bilateral** and **unilateral** exercises. 
- You should be doing both push and pull based exercises. 
- Your weight room exercises should be performed with a **barbell/dumbbell/med ball** instead of machine-based. (so you can fully engage your core). 
- Each session should be started with 1-3 bilateral followed by 1-3 unilateral.

### Off-season
- Build base strength
- 3 x 6-8 reps (choose the weight that you can do 7-9 max reps) for bilateral. 
- 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps for unilateral (**the weight is less important**, you should focus on balance, stability for uni-laterals. )

### Pre-season
- You should start to work up to your max strength. 
- 3-4 sets of 2-4 reps for bilateral with full rest. 
- Unilateral exercises remain the same as off-season.

### On-season
- 50-60% of your 1 max rep; 
- move the bar as fast as possible. 
- Unilateral exercises remain the same.

## Lactic Power
- Increate the amount of the acidity your body can handle before it stops functioning. **No more than 2 per week for lactic power** 
- You should accelerate up to >= 85% of your speed, then you should hold that speed for as long as possible. The distance per rep depends on one's top speed

### Pre-season (**Monitor total volume**)
1. 10 x 80m@90% effort sprinting with walk-back rest.
2. sprinting 80m, then jog 80m repeats
3. 5x200m @85-89% with 3-5 minute recovery.  3 minute recovery on the 85% end, 5 minute recovery on the 89% end. (There is no need to go full 100% effort since your rest time is too short)
4. Stairs run with short interval rest between
5. burpee jumps with high knees

### On-season
1. Once per week, one day rest before and after

## Speed/Power/Plyometrics
- all year round
- e.g. 
	- 30m acceleration with full rest
	- with total volume < 300m

## Tempo
- Keep heart rate 120-140 without creating loads on muscles. 10-15 mins

## Routine
