> **As a general rule before a tennis match, you should eat meals that contain <mark>lean protein</mark> and are high in <mark>simple carbohydrates</mark>, as those are easily digested and will give you energy for the match. You should stay away from foods with a lot of fat and that are hard to digest, as those will slow down your metabolism and make you feel sluggish.**
