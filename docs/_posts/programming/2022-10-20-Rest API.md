REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.

# Uniform Interface:
- you MUST decide APIs interface for resources inside the system which are exposed to API consumers so they can follow it. A resource in the system should have only one logical URI (unique resource identifier), and that should provide a way to fetch related or additional data.

# Richardson Maturity Model: 
- a model that helps us distinguish good from bad API design by assessing how closely an API aligns with the REST framework.
