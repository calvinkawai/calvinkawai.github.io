I have explored different blogging platforms like wordpress.com/org, Wix, and Squarespace since university. My goal of blogging started with in course assignment to a photography portfolio website. And now I want a mix of these places where I can share software development learning progress and a small gallery of candid moments.

Here are why I chose Jekyll

  - Minima theme is simple and clean, and provide enough room to customize the css
  - Markdown language makes the writing process more enjoyable
  - Plus you don't have understand ruby/gem/liquid well to start blogging
