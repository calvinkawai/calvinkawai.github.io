I have explored different blogging platforms like wordpress.com/org, Wix, and Squarespace since university. My goal of blogging started with in course assignment to a photography portfolio website. And now I want a mix of these places where I can share software development learning progress and a small gallery of candid moments.

Here are why I chose Jekyll

-   Easy to start a blog and host on Github page
-   Minima theme is simple and clean, and provide enough room to customize the css
-   Markdown language makes the writing process more enjoyable
-   Plus you don't have to understand ruby/gem/liquid to start blogging

#### [**Download dependencies**](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

#### [**Start the blog with github**](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

# **Customize**

### Navigator

-   Create a markdown file in the main folder (_docs_ from the example) and which will become an item in the navigator bar
    -   or you can create a folder in main folder, and put the following code in \_config.yml file

```
header_pages:
  - header/photography.html
  - header/programming.html
```

### How to change style:

-   create **assets** folder under main folder
-   add [**file**](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/blob/2.5-stable/assets/main.scss) with name **main.scss**

### Create gallery which contains images from specific folder

1.  create **\_includes** folder under main folder
2.  create a [**gallery html template**](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow_gallery.asp) with gallery_template.hmtl
3.  to display images dynamically, use following for loop to wrap your image tag

```html
{ % assign image_files = site.static_files | where: "image", true %}
    { % for myimage in image_files %}
        { %  if myimage.path contains include.folder_name %}
        <div class="mySlides">
            <img src="{ { myimage.path } }" style="width:100%">
        </div>
    { % endif %}
{ % endfor %}
```
