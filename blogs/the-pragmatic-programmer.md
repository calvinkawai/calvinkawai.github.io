### Key takeaways

Pragmatic programming is about adopting a responsible, practical, and flexible mindset in software development. It emphasizes the importance of testing, decoupling, and iterative development, while prioritizing the delivery of working software and the growth of the developer. By embracing these principles, developers can become more effective and efficient in their work.


### Philosophy (Topic 1-7)

- Pragmatic programmers think beyond the problem, placing it in its larger context and seeking out the bigger picture
- Don't make excuses, provide options. When you find yourself saying, "I don't know" be sure to follow it up with "- but I will find out." It's great way to admit what you don't know, but then take responsibility like a pro.
- Negativity can be contagious.
- Don't leave "broken windows" (Bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired.
- Practice situation awareness. Get in the habit of really looking and noticing your surroundings. Then do the same for your project
- The scope and quality of the system you produce should be discussed as part of that system's requirements
- Invest regularly, plan to use a consistent time and place , away from interruption
- The more technologies you are comfortable with, the better you will able to adjust to change
- Learn at least one new language every year
- Read a technical book each month
- Read nontechnical books too
- Take classes
- Participate in local user groups and meetups
- Experiment with different environments (User Windows, Linux, different IDE)
- Stay current (Read news, posts on technology different from that of your current project)
- It doesn’t matter whether you ever use any of these technologies on a project, or even whether you put them on your resume. The process of learning will expand your thinking, opening you to new possibilities and new ways of doing things.
- Plan what you want to say. Write an outline. Then ask yourself, "Does this communicate what I want to express to my audience in a way that works for them" Refine it until it does.

### Approach(Topic 8-15)

- Easier to Change (ETC) principle
- DRY
	- Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system
	- All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation, which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through computation
- Orthogonality means independence or decoupling
- Tracer bullet development is used to get immediate feedback under actual conditions with moving goal
### Basic Tools (Topic 16-22)

### Pragmatic Paranoia (Topic 23-27)

### Bend, or Break (Topic 28-32)

### Concurrency (Topic 33-36)

- Actor model for concurrency!

### While You Are Coding (Topic 37-44)

### Before the project (Topic 45-48)

### Pragmatic Projects (Topic 49-53)
