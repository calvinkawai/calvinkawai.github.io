## Definition

**REST** is a software architectural pattern that defines a set of constrains.
**RESTful API** delivers information of in one of following format, HTML, Json, PHP, Plain Text via http request.

## Constrains

### A Client-Server Architecture

- client requests resources from server via http

### Statelessness

- each request is independent

### Cacheable

- data requested from server side can be stored in client, cdn etc

### A Uniform Interface

- resources requested group by identity (URI)
- resources can be manipulated via representation they receive
- self-descriptive messages returned to client should have enough information to describe how client should process it
- hypertext/hypermedia is available, client can find related actions after accessing a resource

### A layered System

- client does not need to know how server works for those responsible to authorization, load-balancing etc.

## Example

```
GET: /blogs/:id/
```
