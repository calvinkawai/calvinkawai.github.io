Hello! I'm Calvin, based in Toronto, and I'm currently focused on developing web-based tools to streamline digital advertising at [LoKnow](https://loknow.com/). My expertise lies in leveraging the Django, Vue.js, and AWS stacks.

This blog is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history?ref=ideasurg.pub), a concept inspired by the intriguing idea of digital gardening and the profound insights from William Zinsser's Writing to Learn. It's more than just a blog; it's a living, growing space where I nurture my thoughts, learnings, and experiences in technology.
